# Neuro-text
My attempt to implement a neural network trained on text from a file with Internet access. After training, this neural network generates text in the style of the text being submitted to the input. 
In a specific example, 10 epochs and a butch of -128 are used by default. The neural network is trained on the work of L.N. Tolstoy "War and Peace"

P.S. If the network does not accurately generate the text, try to increase the number of training epochs and the training package. Comments in Russian.
